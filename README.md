University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp: Homework 4 (Recommended)

The user will be given a target score between 19 and 120 at the start of the game. There are four crystals, each of which are given a random value between 1 and 12 at the beginning of each game. By clicking on a crystal a specific amount of points will be added to the user score.

The game is won if the user score equals target score. The game is lost  if the user score goes above the target score. 

The value of each crystal is hidden from the user until clicked on.

Each time the game starts, a new target score is generated and the crystal points change.
